# Star-Position-Chart

This is a basic program that takes star data from a dataset, in this case being a .csv file, and plots them on a canvas based on their distance and raw ascension. This is a unique way of displaying star data as it shows how far each star is from us, and not just their locaton in the sky relative to us. It also has various visual configurations, including the option to show color and how much to scale the size of the stars by.
